Hi, I'm Noah Emke. I'm a 2nd year Game Design and Development major at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). 
I have been working mostly in C# with Unity and MonoGame however I am currently exploring C++ as well as HTML and CSS and have prior familiarity in Java. 
I am currently seeking a game development or software engineering co-op over the May-August 2022 summer.
