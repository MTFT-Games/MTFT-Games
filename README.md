Hi, my name is Noah Emke, I'm a 4th year Game Design and Development major with a wide range of experience in software, games, web dev, IT, systems administration, and more. I have professional experience in the IT and service industry and I work on lots of personal projects to put new concepts I learn to work. Ill be graduating this May so I'm currently looking for a full time position as I finish up my college career.
